        <h2>Good Old-Fashioned Pancakes</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
          2 cups all purpose | plain flour, (290 g | 10 oz) 1/4 cup granulated
          sugar or sweetener, (60g | 2 oz) 4 teaspoons baking powder 1/4
          teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 3/4 cups milk, (440ml) 1/4
          cup butter, (60g | 2 oz) 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 large egg
        </p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder,
            baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the
            centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and
            egg.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before
            slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until
            smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).
          </li>
          <li>
            Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or
            griddle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over
            with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour ¼ cup of batter
            onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back
            of your ladle or measuring cup.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the
            surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with
            remaining batter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt,
            or enjoy plain!
          </li>
